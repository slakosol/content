          <h2 class="intext-heading">Kenai Fjords Boat Tour</h2>
          <p class="main-text">
            On the drive from Cooper Landing to Seward, Ben and I caught Tern Lake boiling in the morning rays of the sun as vapor rose from it’s mirror-like surface which extended the mountains and sky into its own reflected dimension.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            The boat raced out of Seward into the mouth of Resurrection Bay, past Fox Island, to our first stop, a sea gull rookery. This swarming fowl metropolis was connected to a migration artery resembling a busy, interstate highway of airborne vessels stretching far along the rocky coast not much unlike the scenes from science fiction movies. Hundreds of birds synchronously sailed the gusts of wind in a collective dance worthy of the Mariinsky, and sang in a roaring falsetto chorus. Below, on a rock protruding from the ocean at the foot of the cliff, sea lions lounged the day away, and coastal mountain goats above navigated the precarious cliffs. Before entering Aialik Cape, we straddled the edge of the Pacific, with endless waters on one side and the evergreen, rocky, winding coast on the other.
          </p>

          <p class="main-text">
            Having entered Aialik Cape, our captain cautiously neared a pair of feeding humpback whales which periodically came up to the surface for air, forcefully and characteristically expelling plumes of water, before waving the boat adieu with their giant tails as they disappeared beneath the murky surface every several minutes to feed.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            We had another expanse of water to traverse before our next destination, the Aialik Glacier. The arctic blue ice, a product of refraction in the ice crystals created from snow under immense pressure, spanned the entire field of view of the human eye even at a distance of few hundred meters. Intricate patterns of cracks and angular protrusions covered the visible surface of the glacier making its tremendous, steady force intermittently known with ruptures of air created by its trudging movement. A seemingly marginal piece of the ice would break off the glacier, fall with shocking violence upon the water, creating an aquatic explosion the audible confirmation of which would reverberate with a momentary delay. Broken ice spilling out into the ocean from the glacier’s terminus formed a galaxy of blocks as varied in shape and size as the stars, home to curious but shy harbor seals and sea otters.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Pummeled with icy wind coming off the glacier and deterred from remaining on the deck by the speed of the boat, Ben and I sat inside the cabin on the way back to Seward until the intrigue roused by the suggestive murmurs among the boat staff enticed us back out to the bow of the boat. First, an orca fin flashed about fifty meters from the boat – the few already at the front of the boat gasped in excitement and surveyed intently the surrounding water – when the orca tauntingly skirted the boat three meters or so right below us – we laughed in disbelief. The captain slowly tailed the pod of orcas for sometime within the bay, offering all passengers the opportunity to see these beautiful and clever marine predators which kept a careful distance. After about 15 minutes, the captain turned the boat homeward, and then, as if performing a dramatic finale for those still watching, the entire pod of three surfaced right at the stern where we were standing, diving below the boat and resurfacing synchronously again on the other side, fully flaunting their brilliance and elegance.

          <h2 class="intext-heading">Canyon Float</h2>
          <p class="main-text">
            One evening while washing my dinner dish in our communal kitchen, Layla, our boathouse manager, approached me with a proposition: remarking upon having regularly seen me going in for river plunges in the frigid Kenai, she shared with me her need for a “swimmer”, a person who goes overboard the raft, on the ultimate day of raft guide training, a mock Canyon Float on the Kenai River with the lodge employees, and offered me a spot. I could not refuse what seemed like the first ever tangible benefit to come from my regular practice of icy masochism. But, it was necessary, for training, for me to fall out of the boat twice and, hopefully, to be rescued by our raft guides.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Before leaving, I was outfitted in a dry suit, and looked like a veritable astronaut, or a Power Ranger.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            It was a rare clear day. The sun was out after being in a week-long seclusion behind the clouds and shone brightly onto the aquamarine water of the Kenai river – the silt in the water giving it it’s unmistakable coloration also gave the surface a milky glow. The river frantically wound through the valley. From the banks, birches and willows, with their bright green foliage, rose and blended with the pine green of spruce. The tree line met the brown smudge of shrubbery halfway up the surrounding mountains. The resilient, low-growing vegetation, too, eventually grew barren, exposing the bare gray rock capped with pristine white snow. The sky blue dome of the celestial sphere, sparsely crowded with full, puffy clouds, hung over this fairy-tale-like landscape.
          </p>
          <p class="main-text">
            Noah, the raft guide, oars in hand, was expounding on tree disease plaguing the spruce along the bank when Layla turned her head giving me a furtive, indicative glance and motioned to pass over my sunglasses. Taking to my task with resolution and haste, I immediately fell backwards off the stern into the water. Excessive angular momentum on entry made me turn and flip underwater. By the time I rose to the surface, the raft was about thirty feet ahead and it wasn’t getting any closer. The dry suit and the PFD with a convenient headrest made the first minute in the 37 degree water cozy as I watched Noah attempt to first slow the raft and then toss a rope to reel me in – Noah failed to hold on to his end of the rope, and threw my lifeline overboard altogether. A minute or two went by as Noah scrambled and I leisurely drifted down the river, doing my best river otter impression, to the amusement of others onboard. Finally, a shout came from Layla that I would, in fact, need to rescue myself and swim to the boat. Not without exertion, I made it back to the boat and Noah dragged me out of the water.
